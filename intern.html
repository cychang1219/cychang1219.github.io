            <p class="content">Hold by Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, which is the most 
                prestigious research institue in Taiwain.Our Summer Students conduct original research at the forefront 
                of observational, theoretical, or laboratory-based topics in astronomy and astrophysics 
                under the supervision of a professional astronomer at ASIAA. Students also attend a series of lectures 
                on basic astronomy to support their projects and for general knowledge. At the end of the 8-week program, 
                students give a final presentation on their research project</p>

            <p class="content">TAOva (Taiwan Astronomical ObserVatories Alliance) is a collaborative platform of observing facilities
                of the community. Funded by the NSTC (National Science and Technology Council), the consortium aims to coordinate 
                resources of existing radio and optical/infrared telescopes for optimal use, providing users supports in 
                preparation of observing proposals, in data processing, thereby promoting collaboration in science and 
                engineering developments. <br />This is to continue the University Consortium of ALMA-Taiwan (UCAT) 
                annual Summer student program (USSP) in previous years, but starting from this year is not limited to radio 
                astronomy. Observational astronomy in all frequency range or theoretical astrophysics is now included, pending 
                upon the faculty members who would sign up in the program.<br/>In addition to working in the host institute, 
                the student will attend lectures given by participating faculty rotating among different campuses together 
                with other fellow students, so as to share research experience with each other. At the end of the program, 
                each student will present a 30-minute lecture and submit a written report on their research results.

            <p class="content">The Theoretical and Computational Astrophysics (TCA) Thematic Group at the National Center 
                for Theoretical Sciences hosts its second undergraduate summer student program in 2022. This program aims 
                to provide research experiences to undergraduate students and equip them with basic theoretical and 
                computational skills. Students will be working under the supervision of domestic astrophysicists, 
                on a wide range of topics from cosmology to planet formation. Frontier techniques in astronomy, 
                problem solving skills, and numerical programing will be learned during this program. 
                Participants are required to present their results publicly at the end of the program. 
                Further continuation of the research project after the summer program can be possible.
