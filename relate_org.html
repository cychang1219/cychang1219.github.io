            <p class="content">In 2014, when university astronomy clubs were facing major difficulties in the 
                age of the internet, several club presidents began a journey of cross-school cooperation and mutual 
                assistance, gradually integrating diverse communities across different regions from their previously 
                independent organizations.<br />
                On March 16, 2019, the National University Astronomy Society Alliance of the Republic of China was 
                officially established as a national social organization. Currently, the alliance is based on more than 
                20 university astronomy societies, with the board of directors, supervisors, and various executive officers 
                mainly composed of retired astronomy society operators. The alliance actively promotes the following tasks:<br />
                University astronomy community mutual assistance platform: integrating the experience, knowledge, and resources 
                of astronomy clubs, promoting inter-school exchanges, and assisting current club operators.</p>

            <p class="content">Established on November 29, 1971, the National Tsing Hua University Astronomy Club is 
                the organizing body for the Sky Kids Astronomy Camp and the founding club of the National University 
                Astronomy Society Alliance. They have four main telescopes with a diameter of over 10 cm, a guiding system,
                a Takahashi EM-200 high-precision equatorial mount, and a Canon EOS 60D astronomical modified DSLR camera.<br />
                Their mission is to promote "amateur astronomy photography," "astronomy popularization and education," 
                and to establish and facilitate the exchange of the university astronomy community.</p>
