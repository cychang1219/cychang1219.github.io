    <h1>Report: Large Coursework </h1>
    <h1>Name:Chiung-Yin Chang</h1>

    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>This website is targeted towards club members who have joined or have an interest in the astrophysics study group. In order to help members understand the group's activities and resources, I have designed five pages that showcase different aspects of the group: the home page, the 2023 spring schedule, recent news, internship opportunities, and related organizations.
        <br/>The home page introduces the history of the study group and showcases active members that newcomers can contact for more information. The schedule page displays the activities for this semester, including dates and topics, so that members can join student seminars or AstroRead sessions that interest them. The recent news section highlights the academic achievements of current members, such as publishing a first-author paper, passing a master thesis defense, or winning poster awards at conferences. By showcasing these achievements, we can advertise our group and offer helpful assistance and resources to those on the path towards becoming astrophysicists.
        <br/>It is also crucial to gain hands-on experience if you're eager to join this field, so we provide information about internship opportunities in Taiwan. Lastly, we introduce and provide a link to the NTHU astro club, which is the study group we belong to. If you're interested in other aspects of astronomy, such as stargazing or astrophotography, you can also join the activities held there. The National University Astronomy Society Alliance of Taiwan is the national social organization that gathers all university astro clubs. By joining them, you can connect with people from all over Taiwan.

    <h2>Inspiration:</h2>
    <p>The website that has given me the most inspiration is the NTHU Astrophysics Study Group website. It provided me with an overview of how to arrange and display important information such as the schedule. Another website that has inspired me is one that was made by other Taiwanese students in this program. They had a tool that displayed the current date and countdown to midterms and finals. This reminded me that if I added the feature of displaying the current date on my website, it would be more convenient for users to check the schedule and application deadlines for internships.

    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p>In my website, I have designed features that allow for adjusting the font size so that individuals with reduced visual ability can still read the website. Additionally, all images on the website include equivalent alternative text in the code. This enables individuals who cannot see and use a screen reader to access the information on the page, including the alt text for the visual image. Lastly, the titles of the pages correspond to their content, which helps users to navigate between pages and understand where they are within the website.</p>

    <h2>Usability</h2>
    <p>All pages on the website have a consistent, simple layout and do not use high-contrast colors, making it easy for users to navigate. The content is also easy to read with distinguishable titles and paragraphs with different font sizes and weights. Additionally, the website is responsive, with hoverable buttons on the navigation bar allowing users to easily identify where they are clicking. The row that the mouse is currently on changes its background color when checking the news or schedule, which helps users focus on the information they need and avoid accidentally reading information from different rows.

    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>The first thing I had to do is deciding the layout of the website, I checked the source code of NTHU Astronomy Club Astrophysics Study Group. They use the template coming from HTML5 UP, the layout is neat and easy to read but the schedule time table is not responsive but only having zebra striped, since I decide show the content in different pages I think it won’t be a huge computation loading to make the schedule row hoverable. After that I drew the frame work of every page and start to construct the HTML and CSS structure of the website. 
        <br/>
        The difficulties I encounter is how to display the photo gallery with description in the section of “active member”. In the beginning I used the table property try to make image arrange equally, but it turn out that it’s not a good way to set since there are both text and image in the same table. After researching I adopted the way that coming from W3C school documentation use to class “row” and “column”, creating side-by-side image with CSS float property.
        <br/>
        The other feature I used in the website is the modal, this included JavaScript to made the modal pop up and also show the “alt” text as a description. After that when click the “x” then the modal will close. I take W3C documentation as a reference and implement in the code successfully.

    <h2>Evaluation I:</h2>
    <p>The first thing I had to do was decide on the layout of the website. I checked the source code of NTHU Astronomy Club Astrophysics Study Group and found that they used a template from HTML5 UP. The layout was neat and easy to read, but the schedule timetable was not responsive and only had zebra stripes. Since I decided to show the content on different pages, I thought it wouldn't be too computationally intensive to make the schedule row hoverable. After that, I drew the framework of every page and started to construct the HTML and CSS structure of the website.
        <br/>One difficulty I encountered was how to display the photo gallery with descriptions in the "Active Member" section. Initially, I used the table property to try to make the images arrange equally, but it turned out that it was not a good way to set it up since there were both text and images in the same table. After researching, I adopted the approach that came from the W3C school documentation, using classes "row" and "column" to create side-by-side images with the CSS float property.

    <h2>Evaluation II:</h2>
    <p>In terms of user experience (UX), I believe that the website lacks an audio component, which may limit its accessibility to some users. Furthermore, the website would benefit from including more images to make it more visually appealing. A slideshow of pictures from past activities or upcoming events could be added to an extra space on the website to make it more eye-catching. This could also help promote the group's activities and encourage more members to participate. Additionally, including alternative text descriptions for these images would ensure that all users, including those who may be visually impaired, can understand the content of the website. Overall, adding more multimedia elements to the website could enhance the user experience and make it more engaging for all visitors.

    <h2>Resources:</h2>
    <p>The most content are coming from the website of National Tsing Hua University Astronomy Club Astrophysics study group [1] except the section “Related organization” and “Intern Opportunities”. The references are mostly come from W3C school and StackOverflow, the text adjusting feature code is coming from the lecture material. The corresponding URL are all commenting in code. The images of planet in the website are coming from NASA, which follows their image using policy: NASA content (images, videos, audio, etc) are generally not copyrighted and may be used for educational or informational purposes without needing explicit permissions.
